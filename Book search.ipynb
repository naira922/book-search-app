For the solutions to exercises 7, 8, and 9, please see the Jupyter notebooks available at https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml. Chapter 15: Autoencoders 1. Here are some of the main tasks that autoencoders are used for: \\u2022 Feature extraction \\u2022 Unsupervised pretraining \\u2022 Dimensionality reduction \\u2022 Generative models \\u2022 Anomaly detection (an autoencoder is generally bad at reconstructing outliers) 2. If you want to train a classifier and you have plenty of unlabeled training data, but only a few thousand labeled instances, then you could first train a deep autoencoder on the full dataset (labeled + unlabeled), then reuse its lower half for the classifier (i.e., reuse the layers up to the codings layer, included) and train the classifier using the labeled data\",\n          \". If you omit the job name and the task index, TensorFlow defaults to the session\\u2019s master task. 326  |  Chapter 12: Distributing TensorFlow Across Devices and Servers Sharding Variables Across Multiple Parameter Servers As we will see shortly, a common pattern when training a neural network on a dis\\u2010 tributed setup is to store the model parameters on a set of parameter servers (i.e., the tasks in the \\\"ps\\\" job) while other tasks focus on computations (i.e., the tasks in the \\\"worker\\\" job). For large models with millions of parameters, it is useful to shard these parameters across multiple parameter servers, to reduce the risk of saturating a single parameter server\\u2019s network card. If you were to manually pin every variable to a different parameter server, it would be quite tedious\",\n          \".target tree_clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=2) tree_clf.fit(X, y) 167 1 Graphviz is an open source graph visualization software package, available at http://www.graphviz.org/.
